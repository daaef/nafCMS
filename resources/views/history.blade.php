                The idea of establishing an air force for Nigeria was first mooted in 1961 following the nation's
                participation in peace-keeping operations in Congo and Tanganyika (now Tanzania). During these
                peace-keeping operations, foreign air forces aircraft were employed to airlift the Nigerian Army
                Regiment to and from the theatres of operation. The Nigerian Government at the time, no doubt,
                recognized the urgent need to establish an air force actively supported by modern facilities to provide
                full complement of forces to enhance the nation's military posture. Early in 1962, the Government agreed
                in principle that the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) be established.

                    <p class="copy-intro-02" style="font-size: 18px;">It was in 1962 that the drive for the required
                        manpower for the planned air force started. Simultaneous with this development, Government was
                        in dialogue with some friendly nations on the possibility of training Nigerian Air Force
                        personnel in various specialist fields. The first batch of 10 cadets was enlisted in 1962 to
                        undergo training with the Ethiopian Air Force. The second set of 16 cadets was enlisted in
                        February 1963 to undergo training with the Royal Canadian Air Force while six cadets were sent
                        to the Indian Air Force. The stage was thus set for the training of its personnel in the
                        country. Consequently, several countries were approached but the lot fell on the German Air
                        Force to provide technical assistance for the local training of NAF personnel and this
                        materialized in 1963.</p>

                <p class="copy-intro-02 text-pushdown-smalltitle" style="font-size: 20px;">While the NAF was still at
                    its infancy as a fighting force, the laudable plans made by the German Air Force Assistance Group
                    were prematurely put to test barely three years after its establishment. The inexperienced Air Force
                    assumed the role of a well established Air Force in order to prosecute the Nigerian civil war in
                    close collaboration with sister Services. At this stage of its existence, the NAF was only equipped
                    with a few aircraft. As the war progressed, some fighter aircraft such as MIG 15 and 17 were
                    acquired to help bring the war to a speedy end.
                    The Nigerian Civil War came to an end in 1970 and there was the need to re-organize the Nigerian Air
                    Force and up-grade its equipment. In order to strengthen itself, the NAF between 1981 and 1990
                    acquired additional aircraft types of advanced technology. With the acquisition of new weapon
                    platforms, there arose the need to train personnel to man and maintain the new aircraft types. This
                    led to the NAF re-organising its training aspects in all NAF trade specialties. </p>

                            support timely, accurate and efficient employment of air power under the direction of the
                            Chief of Air Staff to meet NAF mission.

                            The Training and Operations Branch is responsible for policies and directives for the daily

                            The Nigerian Air Force is currently made up of five Commands namely: Tactical Air Command
                            with headquarters in Makurdi, Special Operations Command with headquarters in Bauchi,
                            Mobility Command with Headquarters in Yenagoa, Training Command with headquarters in Kaduna
                            and Logistics Command with headquarters in Lagos. The Tactical Air Command was established
                            for the purpose of centralization of Command with a view to providing joint operational
                            doctrine for the use of NAF air tactical forces. Similarly, Special Operations Command was
                            established to provide combat support capabilities. Mobility Command is responsible for
                            performing the air power role of tactical and strategic airlift in support of military
                            operations and government. The Training Command was established for the purpose of planning
                            and coordinating the administrative and operational command of all NAF training activities,
                            while the Logistics Command was established to supply and maintain all the NAF operational
                            equipment as well as infrastructural facilities required for the effective accomplishment of
                            NAF assigned tasks.

                            In addition to the five major commands, there are some other formations which are directly
                            answerable to HQ NAF. These are Nigerian Air Force Holdings Company comprising of the
                            Aeronautical Engineering and Technical Services Limited, Nigerian Air Force Post-Service
                            Housing Development Limited, Nigerian Air Force Investment Limited, and Nigerian Air Force

                            To achieve the objectives for which the NAF was set up, the Federal Government has over the
                            years acquired various weapons systems to enable the NAF to effectively perform its roles.
                            There are therefore, various aircraft types currently in operation in the NAF performing
                            different roles. The most recent platforms added to the NAF inventory by the Federal
                            Government are F-7Ni, ATR-42 Maritime Patrol Aircraft and the Agusta Helicopter.</p>

                            Achievement is a subjective term from the point of view of an air force that is charged with
                            specific roles. However, some NAF activities which qualify as achievements are discussed
                            hereunder.

                            At present, the NAF has an aggressive airlift capacity that provides speedy airlift support
                            for sister Services, the Federal Government and its agencies both within and outside the
                            country. The NAF has a Search and Rescue airlift which is made up of helicopters capable of
                            performing large scale rescue operations over jungles, mountains and high seas. The airlift
                            was deployed, for instance, during the NET building fire incidents in 1982 during which many
                            people trapped in the building were airlifted to safety. Another instance where the NAF
                            exploits readily come to mind is in the area of civil aviation.</p>

                            In it's about 48 years of existence; the NAF has taken part in operations in defence of
                            Nigeria's territorial integrity. The NAF participated effectively in troops lift, logistics
                            re-supply, medieval and in combat, Operations HARMONY I to IV conducted in the Eastern flank
                            of the country from the Maiduguri/Chad border to the Bakassi/Cameroonian' area and Operation
                            GABAS in 1987 aimed at flushing out some insurgents from Chad are some good examples.
                            Furthermore, in the discharge of its role of protecting Nigeria from aerial attack, the NAF
                            in conjunction with the Nigerian Army Air Defence Artillery provides low-level air defence
                            for airports around the country. Although lack of serviceable radar and other equipment
                            continue to be a problem, working with other stakeholders, the NAF through the offices of
                            the airport commandants has maintained reasonable level of operational effectiveness. The
                            commencement of work on the military component of the Total Radar Coverage of Nigeria
                            (TRACON) would further enhance NAF's capability in protecting Nigeria's airspace. <br> <br>

                            The NAF also helps to airlift Nigerian contingents to sporting engagements wherever there
                            are flight problems or notice to move in short time. The NAF has over the years participated
                            in various International Peace-keeping Operations in Lebanon from 1978 to 1982, the OAU
                            Peace-keeping Operations in Chad in 1983 during which 144 NAF personnel were awarded OAU
                            Medals; the UN Military Observer Group (UNIMOG) in Yugoslavia in 1988, the ECOMOG Operations
                            in Liberia, UNISOM Operations in Somalia and Rwanda as well as the engagement in Sierra
                            Leone. Furthermore, in support of Government's foreign policy goals, the NAF has in recent
                            times airlifted relief materials to sister African countries devastated by one form of
                            disaster or the other.

                            <br><br> The NAF has similarly systematically localized almost all trades training in
                            pursuance of its local training policy. Because of the high standards of facilities and
                            quality of Instruction in some NAF schools, the Federal Government directed the NAF to
                            provide significant military aid in term of training to some sister African countries. To
                            this end, NAF has in recent years, trained military pilots and aircraft technicians for
                            various African nations. The localization of training has no doubt saved the nation huge
                            sums of foreign exchange in addition to making the country more self-reliance in its
                            training needs.

                            At present, the NAF has an aggressive airlift capacity that provides speedy airlift support
                            for sister Services, the Federal Government and its agencies both within and outside the
                            country. The NAF has a Search and Rescue airlift which is made up of helicopters capable of
                            performing large scale rescue operations over jungles, mountains and high seas. The airlift
                            was deployed, for instance, during the NET building fire incidents in 1982 during which many
                            people trapped in the building were airlifted to safety. Another instance where the NAF
                            exploits readily come to mind is in the area of civil aviation.</p>

                            The NAF participated actively in various operations nationwide in aid to civil
                            power/authorities during the period under review. These missions range from internal
                            security assignments to the provision of airlift to government agencies. When aviation
                            workers abandoned work for one labour protest reason or the other, NAF personnel took over
                            immediate control of the airports in a few instances. In collaboration with other aviation
                            stakeholders such as the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), it monitored the
                            Nigerian airspace and played a supportive role in the implementation of government policies
                            on the National Airport Security Programme. Some instances of NAF participation in aid to
                            civil authority/power are mentioned under internal security and other engagements. <br> <br>

                            In addition to the aforementioned tasks, the NAF aids civil authority in the provision of
                            liaison and light transport for both military and civilian VIPs, airlift for presidential
                            visits, aerial patrol duties and ceremonial displays. Indeed, significant portion of the
                            electoral materials used in the series of elections held in the country were airlifted by
                            the NAF. Its search and rescue efforts helped to save many lives during the NET Building
                            fire in 1982 while NAF pilots and other personnel were involved in various internal security
                            operations.

                            <br> <br> Apart from the normal airlift of electoral materials conducted in support of the
                            numerous electoral bodies in 1991, the NAF played an active part in the verification of
                            voters registration for the then National Electoral Commission (NEC) now Independent
                            National Electoral Commission (INEC). The NAF has also been involved in the patrol of PHCN
                            power lines across the country and is in the forefront of efforts to stop illegal oil
                            bunkering under OPS Restore Hope. Currently, the Nigerian Air Force is involved in internal
                            Security Operations in different parts of the country. Additionally, the NAF is also
                            collaborating with National Emergency Management Agency in disaster response.</p>

                            As currently structured, the NAF has bases in over 17 states across the country. To cater
                            for the welfare and needs of its personnel, hospitals and schools were established. These
                            facilities are often open to the host communities. Through these facilities, the NAF
                            contributes to human and national development. Furthermore, job opportunities are also
                            provided for citizens in some of the ancillary services thereby improving the local
                            populations' living standard. <br> <br>

                            In an effort to achieve a good measure of self sufficiency in aviation technology, NAF
                            entered into a joint venture agreement with the Dornier (AIEP) Limited. The joint venture
                            project culminated in the development and production of made-in-Nigeria aircraft called “Air
                            Beetle”. The aircraft was officially commissioned as part of activities to mark NAF Silver
                            Jubilee celebration in Kaduna, on 22 April, 1989. The aircraft was developed jointly by DANA
                            (AIEP) engineers, NAF pilots, engineers and technicians. Currently, the NAF is also
                            developing national capacity in aviation technology and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
                            through the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) in Kaduna.</p>

                            In the area of peace support operations, the NAF has also left an indelible imprint.
                            Nigeria's outing on UN PSO is perhaps as old as the nation itself. Indeed the need to
                            airlift Nigerian troops to these operations was the main factor that resulted in the
                            formation of the NAF. The first Nigerian troops deployed to Lebanon on UN peacekeeping
                            operations from 1978-1982 relied entirely on NAF airlift assets for their sustenance.
                            <br><br> Also, the deployment and withdrawal of the Nigerian contingent to OAU peacekeeping
                            operations in Chad in 1982/83 were carried out using NAF C-130s. Apart from these major
                            operations, the NAF was involved in peacekeeping efforts in Yugoslavia, Somalia, Rwanda,
                            Kuwait etc. The successes recorded by ECOMOG forces in their peacekeeping and later, peace
                            enforcement efforts in Liberia and Sierra Leone would have been at a far higher cost,
                            without the critical contributions of NAF air power. Currently, NAF C-130s and personnel are
                            involved in airlift missions in International Peace Support Operations in aid of United
                            Nations, African Union and Economic Countries of West African States.</p>

                            With the advent of democracy in May 1999, plans to reverse the downward trend of NAF's
                            fortunes began to be implemented. The democratic government identified the need to have a
                            robust air force, hence, it began to make committed efforts at revitalizing the Service.
                            This entailed revamping ageing platforms and systems as well as inducting new ones. The
                            results of these efforts gradually manifested with the arrival of some of the reactivated
                            aircraft and the delivery of new ones. In 2010, the NAF took delivery of the F-7Nls, the
                            Agusta 109s and ATR 42s. In 2011, 4 Alpha Jets were reactivated through AETSL while 7 others
                            are scheduled to join the fleet soon. Similarly, several other platforms are currently
                            undergoing Periodic Depot Maintenance (PDM). The NAF is now able to meet essential tasks.
                            Similarly, the Super Puma Helicopters are now back to operations after nearly a decade of
                            conservation. <br><br>

                            The challenges of the Vision 20:2020 has brought out the imperative of maintaining a strong
                            air force more than ever before. To this effect, the CAS has coined a vision thus “To
                            transform the NAF into a self-reliant and highly professional fighting force through the
                            application of innovative technology in fulfilment of national defence and security
                            objectives” that should drive the NAF to attain capabilities necessary for the achievement
                            of national objectives. The Vision should see the NAF able to discharge its constitutional
                            responsibilities.

                            <br><br> The NAF will continue to aim at a higher standards of operational excellence and
                            combat readiness in carrying out its statutory roles as assigned by the President,
                            Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari GCFR .
                            Indeed the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Baba Abubakar DFS is also committed to
                            transforming the NAF through his vision to ensure that the Service is transformed into a
                            model fighting force.</p>
